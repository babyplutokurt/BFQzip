# BFQzip

We propose the first lossy reference-free and assembly-free compression approach for FASTQ files, which combines both DNA bases and quality score information in the reads to smooth the quality scores and to apply a noise reduction of the bases, while keeping variant calling performance comparable to that with original data.

The strategy is based on the Extended Burrows-Wheeler Transform (EBWT) and positional clustering, and can be summarized in four main steps:

1. data structures building, for which one could use any state-of-the art tool that computes both the EBWT and its associated permutation of quality scores,

2. positional cluster detecting, according to the positions of local minima in the LCP array,

3. noise reduction and quality score smoothing, 

4. FASTQ reconstruction and compression.

We present implementations in both internal memory and external memory, which largely differ in steps 2-4.

Step 1 can be performed, indeed, by any tool according to the resources available. For example, [gsufsort](https://github.com/felipelouza/gsufsort) runs in internal memory, while [egap](https://github.com/felipelouza/egap) and [BCR](https://github.com/giovannarosone/BCR_LCP_GSA) run in external memory.

Given a FASTQ file containing a collection *S* of reads, both implementations of step 2 need the ebwt(*S*) (EBWT output string) and qs(*S*) (its associated permutation of quality scores), while the external memory version needs in addition the LCP array, lcp(*S*). The internal memory approach represents ebwt(*S*) via the compressed suffix tree described in [Prezza and Rosone, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2020.11.024), where the lcp(*S*) is deduced from the ebwt(*S*). 

## Install

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/veronicaguerrini/BFQzip
cd BFQzip 
make
```

## Run

Given in input 
We propose three different modes to compress FASTQ files by using two well-known compressors: PPMd [https://www.7-zip.org/7z.html] and BSC [http://libbsc.com/].



Given a string collection in FASTQ format (e.g. example/reads.fastq), to run BFQzip in internal memory

```sh
python3 BFQzip.py example/reads.fastq -o output_reads
```
while to run BFQzip in external memory

```sh
python3 BFQzip_ext.py example/reads.fastq -o output_reads
```
